# nvchad-custom
The nvchad v2.5 setup with custom config for neovim. This repository is created by referencing NvChad/starter repository.

#### Setup
Run below command to install nvchad with this custom config
```
git clone https://github.com/vnvim/nvchad-custom ~/.config/nvim
```

This custom config of nvchad internally uses `v2.5` branch of main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) as a plugin. So with this setup you get nvchad with the custom configs.
After setup you just need to launch neovim using `nvim` command and you are good to go.

#### What's added to this nvchad custom config
- Added gitsigns mappings
- Swap file creation is disabled
- Using vscode_colored theme for status line
- Updated status line to also show the cursor position in percentage
